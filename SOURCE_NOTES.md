# Source / provenance notes

The extractor is grounded against Peter's verified US retail PSIV ROM and the public `ps4disasm` work. No ROM bytes are shipped in this repository beyond very short structural signatures used as tests.

## Public reverse-engineering references used

- `squidfeatures/ps4disasm` (`ps4.asm`, `ps4.constants.asm`), including the documented record layouts and stable symbolic IDs.
- `alechenninger/ps4disasm`, a later fork used as an additional orientation/reference source.

The public disassembly documents, among other things:

- initial character records as 66-byte entries
- inventory records as 22-byte entries
- enemy records as 48-byte entries
- enemy-skill records as 8-byte entries
- techniques, skills, and combo records as 8-byte entries
- vehicle records as 26-byte entries
- character level records as 22-byte entries, addressed through a per-character pointer table

## Retail US offsets proven against this ROM

- Enemy data: `0x2816BC`
- Enemy skills: `0x28336C`
- Combo data: `0x285424`
- Vehicle data: `0x2855E2`
- Level pointer table: `0x004074`
- Primary Chaz level table / start of primary progression block: `0x2856B0`
- Mirrored progression block: `0x2A3A42`
- Initial character stats: `0x2A8ACA`
- Inventory data: `0x2A8E28`
- Technique data: `0x2A9BE8`
- Skill data: `0x2A9D28`

The offsets are accepted only after the full ROM SHA-256 matches the supported retail build, then short known signatures are checked again at those offsets before extraction.

## Important boundary

`ITEM_SYMBOLS` and `ENEMY_SYMBOLS` are disassembly identifiers, not decoded cartridge text. This is intentional. The eventual text-system decoder should own actual display names so this tooling does not silently blend researcher labels with source-ROM text.
